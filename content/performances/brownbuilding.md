**Location**: Brown Building, San Diego, CA

## Overview

Light production and video projections for experimental, ambient, noise live performances.  
_Music by Geour, Elliot Varon, and Auto Technik_

I designed the lights and projections with the goal of complementing the texture of the sounds created by the musicians.
Therefore, the sounds created by the musicians drove the lights and video synthesis, creating a closed loop system.
A midi keyboard and a play station controller were repurposed for additional control and sequencing.

Techniques used:

- 3D printed light fixtures
- Custom computer controlled dimmers
  - custom circuit design
  - arduino
- Live visual projections
  - Touchdesigner
  - Recorded video footage
