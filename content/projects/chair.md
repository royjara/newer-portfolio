# Sometimes I wish the music would know how I feel

## Overview

Interactive sound and haptic installation using a found object (chair), sensors, and a haptic speaker, developed using Max/MSP. A generative envelope sequencer periodically creates rhythmic patterns based on the sensor readings. The Max/MSP interface allows for further tuning of the installation by changing the sample playback speeds, their gains, their envelopes. Additionally, presets can be saved and toggled by interacting with the chair with percussive hits (e.g.knocking). The deconstructed sounds and periodic loops triggered by an unorthodox controller help to envision a connected future where generative music can sense us and respond accordingly.
